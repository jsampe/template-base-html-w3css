# Template w3css.

W3 CSS templates. w3 css pure templates is a new, faster and lighter way than engines based on java scripts to build their themes.
It is my favorite to build simple projects.

This folder contains our themes designed by us from scratch, to learn how to make HTML / CSS themes with the use of w3.css and the separation of HTML and CSS code.

This design tries to make maximum impact on simplicity, cleanliness and readability.

It contains three variants of the same design:

- Complete page, with header and footer.
- Same with a side.
- Same with two sides.

The colors and elements have been designed with sizes and tones to facilitate layout.
